 ## Author's/Developer's note

 This is an implementation of what I am reffering to as the Mechanician game system, built for [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](http://foundryvtt.com).
 The Mechanician game system retains most of the FATE Condensed mechanics and adds to it, often with the assistance of the FATE System Toolkit. 
 It was built with a specific story and setting in mind (the "Mechanician" setting, hence the systems immensly creative name), though may be adapted to others.
 The system is hardly a "system" in the sense that it is by and large another iteration of FATE (which is the entire point of FATE).
 The setting and story may be used for personal uses, though not for profit. 

 Many of the software features included in this system may be found as independent 'modules' (as they are termed in Foundry VTT). Those wishing to use some of the
 the features without the setting content can install the modules through the typical Foundry VTT interface. You can find the modules code [here] if you desire to tinker (...nerd).
